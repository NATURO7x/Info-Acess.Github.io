 <!-- ROOT -->
<h2>Informaton about root</h2>

<p>Root, When you acess everyting in your phone it is called root.</p>
<p>You will think that we already have full acess of our phone but there some places that we can see and edit and root or flashing (I will talk about flashing soon) give us permission to do it. But its very senstive because it will have files of your phone os (os means system of your phone) and if it gets damage your phone will not turn on some times.So if you want to root your device, it can damage your phone so dont try on new phone without experience or information about it. <a href="https://youtube/ADcjIE7DZbE" target="_blank">tutorial to root any device INCLUDED Redmi AKA Mi </a> </p> 

<!-- FASTBOOT -->
<h2>Information about flashing</h2>

<p>Flashing, When you went a file, a app and os and our phone does not allow us to do and it is possible, its mainly done by a root master AKA Masik manager or custom recovery
    (like twrp or orange fox recovery).See when our phone gets old its become slow and our phone's os also gets slow after time like 3 or 5 years. So we install custom roms, there are OS that doesn't come with a mobile phone,they are made to insatll in phone through flashing and they are different types of them some for more battery backup so battery gets drag slow or some for perfomation to play games at high fps like <strong>evolation x OS</strong> </p>

<!-- CUSTOM ROMS -->
<h2>Information about custom roms</h2>

<p>Custom roms, Are made to enhance our phone perfomation or battery backup but sometimes, custom roms doesn't have rom for your mobile, So downloading Unofficall rom can be riskey it can be virus so always check your rom its officall and not a virus. </p>
